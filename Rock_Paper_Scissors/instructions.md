# Instructions about the Task!

Since AugRay is a company based on the technology of Computer Vision, we are going to learn the basic of Computer Vision using a popular Python library called [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/).

And we are going to do this by creating a game.

Most importantly you are required to use GitHub for collaborating with the coding work involved and also because it will be easy for me to check your code, review it and if you guys run into issues fix it as well.

# Here is what the you are going to build:

You are going to build a game where you can play **"rock paper and scissors"** with the computer by actually playing it (what I mean to say is using your hand)

To do this you will need to do the following:
1. access your laptop's camera
2. record and save images of your hand
3. pre-process the data you have collected
4. train a neural network model using the data collected
5. write logic to play the game

As you can see this is a 5 step process, out of which the first 3 steps will include the use of the library OpenCV.<br/>
The 4th step, since it's difficult and many of you may not be able to do it on your own, I am gonna write a python script which will do this for you and we will get to the details of this later on. <br/>
And step 5 is something where we test your basic logic.

I will be providing links to OpenCv's [documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html) and links to some [online tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS1QulWo1RIa7D1O6skqDQ-JZ1GGHKK-K) which I used to learn the technology, you are not required to follow the same, but these are some good materials which might help you.

Learning OpenCV and doing this project will help you learn the technology as well as gives you something to put on your resume as well, which will be of great value!

So try your best to complete the project and learn the technology behind it!
